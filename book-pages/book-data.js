      "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.",
    thoughts:
      "The first time I read this book was during the pandemic lockdowns. I knew I wanted to lead a healthier life but I was not sure what that would look like or how I could get there. As I read, I considered some possibilities - quitting smoking, incorporating some vegetables into my diet, and replacing some of my daily walks with HIIT workouts - but I was not fully committed to actually making these changes. The book gave me hope that when I was ready to fully commit, change would be possible. After sitting in my own frustration for a couple of years, I came back to Atomic Habits with the intention of taking real action. This time, I was ready to leverage the habit system as a tool for success. A year later, my weight and heart health have improved - and I am smoke free.",
    aboutTheAuthor:
      "After being hit in the face with a baseball bat in high school, Clear finished his college career earning accolades and honors for his academic and athletic performance. Clear is a bestselling author and keynote speaker. In Atomic Habits, he shares how he designed and leveraged a system of small daily actions to help him achieve his goals.",
    ideas: [
      "The long-term impact of doing something once will likely be small. The actions you take daily, however, compound their impacts over time.",
      "Winners and losers have the same goals, but different ways of achieving them. Goals represent where you want to go. Systems are habits that will get you there.",
      "Design a system you love and identify with that will take you to your goals. Instead of thinking 'I want this', try thinking 'I am this'. As you repeat actions outlined by the system you designed, you will create reinforcing evidence that supports your 'I am' statement.",
      "Habits are a logical, 4-stage problem/solution process. You experience a cue in your environment that triggers a craving. To satisfy the craving, you respond with a specific action and receive a reward of some kind for your action.",
      "You can leverage this process to help you design and build strong habit systems. Modify your environment to reduce friction for habits you want to encourage, and add barriers for habits you want to reduce. Make sure you see the rewards of your actions to stay motivated.",
      "Don't beat yourself up if you miss a day - you don't have to be perfect, but you do need to keep momentum. If you stay diligent, the effects of your actions will compound over time.",

      "I read Build after hearing Tony Fadell on the Lex Fridman podcast. At the time, I was thinking about what my career growth might look like. In my largely autonomous current role as 'the tech person' at a small financial firm, I leverage my financial and technical backgrounds to make decisions that support a broader team. While I do not have a crystal ball to tell me what my role and career will look like in 5 years, I do have a compass - partially fashioned from the wisdom and unique perspective Fadell shares in Build.",

    ideas: [
      "Early in your career, you have more freedom than you had as a child, teenager, and college student. You will have less of this freedom once you start a family. So, try new things, learn from your failures, and pursue your passions.",
      "Make investments in yourself by finding a job where you can learn and grow. Seize opportunities to see beyond your job duties; stay aware of other team and role objectives, and connect with other professionals both within and outside of your company.",
      "Companies used to promote skilled employees to managers by default. Nowadays, employers are recognizing that while some people will make great people-oriented managers with a breadth of knowledge, others will flourish as talented individual contributors who develop expertise in their craft.",
      "Launching your own product can be scary. It is helpful to have experience working for both large and small companies, and even better to have failed startup experience. A mentor or co-founder can help provide guidance. Venture Capitalists can help fund your efforts and provide valuable guidance, but be advised, your company is not their primary interest.",
      "When you design a product, aim for it to be disruptive to the market and well-executed. Your vision will drive version 1 of the product. Version 2 should leverage data insights and customer feedback to iterate on version 1. Version 3 will be an intentionally designed product with a real business to back it up - at this point, you'll start having some functions done in-house. Build fast, fail fast, and improve iteratively as you learn.",
      "The customer experience is more than just using the product. It also includes the stories that introduce and persuade the customer, the purchasing and unboxing experience, and troubleshooting. From day 1, the product development process should include marketing efforts to understand the customer and tell a great story. PMs are another key part of the design process; Product Managers help guide the product evolution in a way that customers want and the team can support, while Project Managers help manage the project cadence and eliminate obstacles for the team.",
      "If your product is successful, you'll face new challenges as a growing business. At some point, you won't be able to personally interview every candidate, and you won't be able to get cake and have an afternoon celebration for every employee's birthday. Build a culture of growth by incorporating stories of team success through difficult times into the company history. ",
      "One day, you may find yourself as a CEO. In this role, you must accept that you are not an expert in every facet of the business. Your opinions shouldn't invalidate others - but you will have to hold fast to the vision, demonstrate your care for the mission, and say 'no' when it makes sense. The Board holds the CEO accountable through their love of the company and may choose to appoint someone else as CEO if needed. Acquisitions should be considered for improving culture fit and synergy through purchase of a product, team, or customer base, rather than for making more money.",

    aboutTheAuthor:
      "David Bradford and Carole Robin are both professors at Stanford. There, they developed a program called Interpersonal Dynamics, also known as 'Touchy-Feely'.",
    ideas: [
      "Exceptional relationships are those where you can fully be and develop yourself through trust, honesty, vulnerability, and productive conflict resolution.",
      "Growth happens through vulnerability. Share your vulnerabilities through statements about your emotions, rather than just facts. Encourage others to open up by affirming their emotions and asking for elaboration. Try to empathize with their perspective, staying in tune with both their emotions and your own. Over time, this builds deep trust.",
      "Growth can be blocked by fear of conflict. Allowing yourself to be an echo chamber or a doormat for the other person preserves niceties, but prevents both parties and the relationship from fulfillment. Be clear about what you want, and understanding of what the other person wants.",
      "When conflict does occur, try to address the problem while it is still small, before it grows into a larger issue with deeper ugly feelings (such as jealousy, resentment, or indifference) at play. Conflict resolution works best when the problem is approached with curiosity - when both parties are invested in walking through all of the issues, finding a resolution that deepens the relationship, and repairing any hurt feelings.",
      "Within an interaction, both parties know the observable behavior. But, only one knows the intention, and the other knows the impact. When you share feedback, try focusing on the objective behavior and the impact it had on you. Stay away from using the feedback sandwich approach or assuming the intent of the other person.",
      "When the other person shares their feedback, listen actively by nodding, acknowledging their feelings, and providing a space for them to continue sharing. Avoid judging or giving advice (unless they ask for it). Instead, focus on staying curious and empathetic, especially when you disagree with their perspective. If the other person is having difficulty, help them by asking about what behaviors led them to feel the emotions they feel.",
      "You may face challenges sharing feedback because you are blocking emotions, getting defensive, or making up stories about the other person. Getting caught up in denial, explanations/excuses, retaliation, questioning intent, blaming, or insults will block a successful resolution. Remember, you are discussing the conflict out of care for the relationship and the desire to see it thrive.",

      "My parents gave me this book shortly before I graduated college. This was such a timely gift! I spent the first few years out of college trying out different roles at different companies, trying to find the best fit for my nature and skill set. I kept coming back to this book for reassurance that life is a journey of exploration, not something I need to have figured out in my early 20s - and for a reminder that it is okay to try new things!",
    aboutTheAuthor:
      "In this book, Burnett and Evans share the design approach taught in their Stanford course, 'Designing Your Life'. Burnett's experience includes directing the Stanford Design Program and serving as CEO of a design consultancy. Evans has co-founded Electronic Arts and lectured as part of the Stanford Design Program. Both are co-founders of the Life Design Lab.",
    ideas: [
      "When you first start intentionally designing your life, start with where you are today. How are you doing? How do you feel? Consider the four main areas of your life - health, work, leisure, and relationships. Then, go deeper and ask yourself some difficult questions, like 'What does work mean to me?' and 'Why are we alive?'.",
      "Build your way forward by following what excites you. Keep a journal of specific activities that energize you and keep you engaged. You might feel like you dislike your job, but what specific tasks are draining you, boring you, or causing you stress? What activities make you lose track of time and feel good?",
      "Explore alternative lives you would live if constraints were lifted. What would your life look like if you fully committed to your current path? What would it look like if you could not pursue your current path? What would it look like if money didn't matter? Avoid latching on to the first idea you have, and instead, use mind-mapping to explore many different possibilities.",
      "You don't have to make drastic changes to explore possibilities. Instead, talk to others who are doing what you want to do. Listen to their perspective and ask questions. Find other ways to get involved to see if you like something as much as you imagined you would. For example, if you are considering becoming a veterinarian but you currently work as an accountant, you can gain an understanding of what working with animals is like by talking to veterinarians and volunteering at a local animal shelter.",
      "Life is temporary. Your life is your evolution process, including the choices you make and what you learn from your failures. Don't focus so much on the goals that you miss the joy of becoming more you.",

      "This is another book I discovered on the Lex Fridman podcast. In the episode, Lex and Jo discuss how students come to believe that math and other STEM subjects are too hard for them, and how this belief limits their ability to succeed. This episode hit home for me because in high school, I dreamed of becoming an engineer, but I gave up on this dream after receiving my first grade F on a test in my advanced physics class. As an adult, I've gone on to nurture my passions and curiosity through self-study of science, math, and computer programming. However, I wonder how much farther I could have gone in school (and how much kinder I could have been towards myself) if I knew that with a growth mindset, I could master physics, as well as any 'hard' subject.",
