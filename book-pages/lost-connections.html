            Johann Hari has been taking antidepressants since he was a teenager, and has long wondered if there may be more effective solutions.

            <li>
              Pharmaceutical companies selectively publish studies that highlight
              antidepressants as effective. Unpublished studies suggest that
              improving sleep works better as an antidepressant than medications,
              which may have a placebo effect at best.
            </li>
            <li>
              The DSM, a diagnosis tool, previously included a clause that said if a person
              is grieving, their signs of depression are a rational grief response
              rather than depression to be treated. This clause was later removed. Could
              depression be a rational response to other life circumstances?
            </li>
            <li>
              Studies show that people are likely to become depressed when they face a long term stressor or difficult situation without the social support they need. Common causes of depression include feeling disconnected from a meaningful occupation, meaningful relationships, nature, and one's values. Childhood trauma and genetics play a role, though a smaller one than commonly thought.
            </li>
            <li>
              Several anecdotes shared in the book provide evidence that depression can be cured without antidepressants. In Cambodia, a citizen became depressed after being injured so that he could no longer work as a rice farmer. His home village came together to give him a cow and he was able to become a cow farmer. This connection to meaningful work as a way to provide for himself eventually alleviated his depression.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hari suggests that effective antidepressants can be found in rebuilding one or more broken connections to meaning. Some actionable antidepressants:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Do something with others that lifts you up, preferably in
                  nature. For example, you could plant a community garden.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pursue autonomous, meaningful work where you feel you make an
                  impact and do a good job.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Process internal childhood trauma. A therapist can help you talk through and heal from past challenges, current problems, and future worries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Consider how your lifestyle upholds your values. Develop a
                  positive vision for where you see yourself in 5 years. Design and live a life that embodies these values and brings you closer to achieving your goals.
                </li>
