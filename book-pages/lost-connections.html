          Author Johann Hari asserts that depression is a reasonable reaction to
          one's life circumstances, with logical resolutions that provide
          lasting relief.

          Johann Hari has been taking antidepressants since he was a teenager,
          and has long wondered if there may be more effective solutions.

        <ul class="ideas">
          <li>
            Pharmaceutical companies selectively publish studies that highlight
            antidepressants as effective. Unpublished studies suggest that
            improving sleep works better as an antidepressant than medications,
            which may have a placebo effect at best.
          </li>
          <li>
            The DSM, a diagnosis tool, included a clause that said if a person
            is grieving, their signs of depression are a rational grief response
            rather than depression to be treated. This clause was removed. Could
            depression be rational responses to other life circumstances?
          </li>
          <li>
            Studies show that people are likely to become depressed when they
            face a long term stressor or difficult situation without the social
            support they need.
          </li>
          <li>
            Common causes of depression include feeling disconected from a
            meaningful occupation, other people, nature, and one's values.
            Childhood trauma and genetics also play a role.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Cambodia, a citizen became depressed after being injured and
            unable to work. The village came together to give the guy a cow and
            he was able to become a farmer. He was eventually happier.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hari suggests that effective antidepressants can be found in
            reconnections. Some actionable antidepressants:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Do something with others that lifts you up, preferably in
                nature. For example, you could plant a garden.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pursue autonomous, meaningful work where you feel you make an
                impact and do a good job.
              </li>
              <li>
                Process internal childhood trauma. A therapist can be helpful
                here.
              </li>
              <li>
                Consider how your lifestyle upholds your values. Develop a
                positive vision for where you see yourself in 5 years.
