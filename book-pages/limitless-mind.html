          An advocate helping students reach their true potential, Jo Boaler
          co-founded youcubed, an online resource for students and teachers to
          connect with math in new ways. Jo further supports positive change in
          the education space through her work as a professor in the Stanford
          Graduate School of Education.

          <li>
            Education systems frequently teach kids to have a "fixed" mindset
            about whether or not they are smart. This limits what they can
            achieve. People with a fixed belief that they are smart will select
            easy assignments that validate this idea rather than tasks that
            challenge them to grow; they often give up at the first sign of
            struggle. People with a fixed mindset that they are
            <em>not</em> smart write off subjects like math and science as too
            hard for them, never allowing themselves to seriously try.
          </li>
          <li>
            Science supports the idea that a growth mindset, a belief that you
            can learn anything, unlocks limitless possibilities for students and
            adults alike. Contrary to popular belief, we do not lose our ability
            to learn at a specific age. Our neuroplastic brains frequently
            change structure to support tasks we repeat and meet challenges.
            Studies show that the most effective forms of practice are right at
            the edge of our understanding - not so hard that we give up, but not
            so easy that we do not grow. <em>We can learn anything.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            In grades 1, 2, and 3, students often learn and practice math using
            sheets of the same problems over and over again. Schools test
            students by timing how fast they can complete the sheet. This type
            of learning, practicing, and testing discourages students who have
            trouble memorizing things or performing under pressure. It also does
            little to foster a deeper connection to math.
          </li>
          <li>
            Studies show students succeed in math when they use multiple
            different approaches to engage with the concepts. Instead of
            repeating the facts rapidly, students can explore problems and
            concepts through visuals, stories, and collaboration. This approach
            improves math proficiency as well as confidence and self esteem in
            students.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students and adults grow and improve in environments where mistakes
            and failure are viewed as learning opportunities rather than
            something to punish or shame. Choosing novel, challenging tasks and
            approaching them with freedom, creativity, and collaboration fuels
            brain growth.
