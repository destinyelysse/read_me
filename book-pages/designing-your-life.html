        <ul class="ideas">
          <li>
            As you begin designing your life, start with where you are. How are
            you doing and feeling as far as your health, work, leisure, and
            relationships? Then, assess your views towards work and life,
            answering questions like "what does work mean to me?" and "why are
            we alive?". Don't be afraid to go deep!
          </li>
          <li>
            Build your way forward by following what excites you. Keep a journal
            of specific activities that energize you and keep you engaged. You
            might feel like you dislike your job, but what specific tasks are
            draining you, boring you, or causing you stress? What activities
            make you lose track of time and feel good?
          </li>
          <li>
            Explore alternative lives you would live if constraints were lifted.
            What would your life look like if you fully committed to your
            current path? What would it look like if you could not pursue your
            current path? What would it look like if money didn't matter? Avoid
            latching on to the first idea you have, and instead, use
            mind-mapping to explore many different possibilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            You don't have to make drastic changes to explore possibilities.
            Instead, talk to others who are doing what you want to do. Listen to
            their perspective and ask questions. Find other ways to get involved
            to see if you like something as much as you imagined you would. For
            example, if you are considering becoming a veterinarian but you
            currently work as an accountant, you can gain an understanding of
            what working with animals is like by talking to veterinarians and
            volunteering at a local animal shelter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Life is temporary. Your life is your evolution process, including
            the choices you make and what you learn from your failures. Don't
            focus so much on the goals that you miss the joy of becoming more
            you.
          </li>
