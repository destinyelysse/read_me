          <ul class="ideas">
            <li>
              Lencioni's fable follows Jeff, a Silicon Valley tech startup
              co-founder turned small business consultant, whose life changes
              with an unexpected opportunity from his uncle Bob. Bob wants Jeff
              to run the company when he retires in a couple of years, and Jeff
              accepts. Jeff gets up to speed with how things run at the company,
              and everything is going smoothly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Until one day, Uncle Bob lets Jeff know that the company has
              accepted two large contracts that it does not have the staff to
              fulfill - and for legal reasons, they can't back out of either
              job. The company must hire 100 employees in the next couple of
              months in order to meet their capacity needs. Already, the company
              is facing issues with its staff and projects, largely due to
              issues among some of the managers. Jeff worries about how they
              will hire and retain enough quality teammates to complete the
              projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, Uncle Bob tells Jeff that he is facing serious health issues
              and must step away from the business to get treatment and recover.
              Jeff suddenly becomes the CEO.
            </li>
            <li>
              The other two executives, Claire and Bobby, are supportive of Jeff
              and more than willing to help him navigate the hiring challenges
              ahead. The three colleagues (and friends, as the fable tells)
              evaluate internal employees as well as potential candidates,
              talking through their ideas about how to identify someone who will
              work well on their team.
            </li>
            <li>
              Throughout their adventures, they identify 3 key characteristics
              of someone who works well on a team:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Hungry: A teammate who is willing to put in extra effort to
                  accomplish team objectives
                </li>
                <li>Humble: A teammate who does not have a huge ego</li>
                <li>
                  Smart: Not "Book Smart" - This is a teammate who is people
                  smart and is nice to interact with
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              An Ideal Team Player has all 3 of these virtues. Teammates who do
              not have all 3 may have a hard time working at a company whose
              values incorporate this model, and will face challenges unique to
              their combination of the virtues. Someone who is lacking in one of
              the areas can certainly grow and improve if they are willing and
              have teammates willing to support their development.
            </li>
            <li>
              Teams can improve their ability to hire ideal team players by
              asking questions that point the candidate towards a specific
              trait.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Listen to the stories a candidate shares in a behavioral
                  interview.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Do they share stories of accomplishments with their team?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Do they seem to enjoy a challenge and feel passionate about
                  the company's mission?
                </li>
                <li>Do you enjoy talking to the person?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
