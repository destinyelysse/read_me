        <p class="author-text">
          After being stabbed while waiting for a train as an adolescent, Miodownik developed a fascination with steel, and then with all kinds of materials. His curiosity led him to pursue a degree in materials science at Oxford University and a career as a materials scientist/engineer. Miodownik is currently a professor of materials and society at University College London and the director of a materials library, Institute of Making.

              Metals can be made softer with heat or harder with hammering. Metals can be alloyed with other materials for different characteristics - for example, steel stays sharp and strong depending on how iron and carbon are combined. When combined with chromium, steel becomes self-repairing (rather than rusting) and tasteless, which makes it a choice material for cutlery. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Paper is produced when wood pulp from trees is chemically bleached. It is then treated with other chemicals and bonders to give it unique properties, such as a specific depth for ink to soak in or the ability to react with silver to produce photos. Though digital means of doing things are slowly replacing paper, it remains in use today because of its sentimentality in activities like handwriting or reading a book. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Concrete, frequently used in buildings, is a mix of water and rock that can crack under weight or with the natural expanding and contraction of buildings. It can be made stronger when mixed with steel but then becomes prone to rust. New innovations to concrete include using bacteria to make it a self-repairing material resistant to rust.

              Chocolate is a well-loved, aromatic confection. Its flavor is largely determined by how nuts harvested from cocoa pods ferment in the sun before being mixed with milk, sugar, and other ingredients. It can be mixed differently for different purposes, such as cooking, coating ice cream, or eating on its own.
            </li>

              Silica aerogel is a material with a sky blue hue because it reflects light similarly to how the atmosphere does. Though it is the lightest material known, it is incredibly heat resistant. Placing it between a flame and a flower will prevent the petals from burning. NASA uses the material to capture space material.

              Adequate sleep provides proper management of short and long term
              memory, and improves learning outcomes.

              Sleep deprived people are not aware of their impaired performance,
              which declines to that of a drunk driver after 19 hours awake.
              Every hour, someone dies in a car accident resulting from lack of
              sleep. Sleep deprivation erodes productivity in office workers and
              produces the 3rd leading cause of death - medical errors.
