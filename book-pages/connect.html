          <li>
            Exceptional relationships are those where you can fully be and
            develop yourself through trust, honesty, vulnerability, and
            productive conflict resolution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Growth happens through vulnerability. Share your vulnerabilities
            through statements about your emotions, rather than just facts.
            Encourage others to open up by affirming their emotions and asking
            for elaboration. Try to empathize with their perspective, staying in
            tune with both their emotions and your own. Over time, this builds
            deep trust.
          </li>
          <li>
            Growth can be blocked by fear of conflict. Allowing yourself to be
            an echo chamber or a doormat for the other person preserves
            niceties, but prevents both parties and the relationship from
            fulfillment. Be clear about what you want, and understanding of what
            the other person wants.
          </li>
          <li>
            When conflict does occur, try to address the problem while it is
            still small, before it grows into a larger issue with deeper ugly
            feelings (such as jealousy, resentment, or indifference) at play.
            Conflict resolution works best when the problem is approached with
            curiosity - when both parties are invested in walking through all of
            the issues, finding a resolution that deepens the relationship, and
            repairing any hurt feelings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Within an interaction, both parties know the observable behavior.
            But, only one knows the intention, and the other knows the impact.
            When you share feedback, try focusing on the objective behavior and
            the impact it had on you. Stay away from using the feedback sandwich
            approach or assuming the intent of the other person.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the other person shares their feedback, listen actively by
            nodding, acknowledging their feelings, and providing a space for
            them to continue sharing. Avoid judging or giving advice (unless
            they ask for it), and instead focus on staying curious and
            empathetic, especially when you disagree with their perspective. If
            the other person is having difficulty, help them by asking about
            what behaviors led them to feel the emotions they feel.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may face challenges sharing feedback because you are blocking
            emotions, getting defensive, or making up stories about the other
            person. Getting caught up in denial, explanations/excuses,
            retaliation, questioning intent, blaming, or insults will block a
            successful resolution. Remember, you are discussing the conflict out
            of care for the relationship and the desire to see it thrive.
