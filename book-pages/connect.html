              Sleep is likely an evolutionary trait that supports our brains in
              creativity, intelligence, and emotional regulation. REM sleep is
              considered an evolutionary benefit that made humans the dominant
              species.
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether you are a morning lark or a night owl, you have a natural
              circadian rhythm that determines your sleep cycle. Humans need
              about 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Melatonin can help adjust
              your body clock from jet lag, but will not improve sleep quality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sleep consists of 90 minute cycles of NREM and REM sleep. During
              NREM sleep, brain waves move in unison from the front of the brain
              to the back, moving memories from short term to long term storage.
              During REM sleep, the brain paralyzes the body and dreams occur
            </li>
            <li>
              Some animals dream, and some sleep with half their brain. There is
              not a clear detemining factor for the amount of sleep a specific
              species needs. We are the only species that wakes up artificially.
            </li>
            <li>
              Babies are sleep nearly the entire time they are in the womb. REM
              sleep is critical for development in the third trimester and for a
              while after birth. Sleeping in a hospital is difficult yet
              critical for patients, especially premature babies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Children and elderly people have early circadian rhythms, while
              teenagers have theirs shifted forward much later. A lack of sleep
              may cause psychological disorders in teenagers and young adults,
              and dementia, alzheimers, among other illnesses in elders. Schools
              are not teaching the benefits of getting enough sleep, and and
              start too early for the natural teenage circadian rhythm. Students
              perform on average 200 SAT points better when high school start
              times are pushed forward 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adequate sleep provides proper management of short and long term
              memory, and improves learning outcomes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sleep deprived people are not aware of their impaired performance,
              which declines to that of a drunk driver after 19 hours awake.
              Every hour, someone dies in a car accident resulting from lack of
              sleep. Sleep deprivation erodes productivity in office workers and
              produces the 3rd leading cause of death - medical errors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduced sleep weakens the immune system and causes faster aging.
              Sleep deficiency increases your chances of heart attack by 200%.
              It is a leading cause of type 2 diabetes. Rats die after
              approximately 20 days with no sleep.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dreams heal emotional difficulties and solve problems. During
              dreaming, the visual, motor, emotional, and autobiographical
              portions of the brain become active. The prefrontal cortex becomes
              inactive and the brain paralyzes the body.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lucid dreamers can control their dreams. Sleepwalking is a rare
              and usually harmless condition. Emotional worry or stress can
              cause insomnia.
            </li>
            <li>
              While advancements in electricity and technology are beneficial
              for many reasons, innovations have negatively impacted sleep. A
              bedside lamp is powerful enough to alter your brain's sleep
              signals. Advancements in smart technology, like AI powered
              thermostats and lights, can be used to promote sleep.
            </li>
            <li>
              Alcohol significantly impairs your sleep and dramatically
              decreases your memory abilities. Sleeping pills do not produce a
              natural sleep and have negative impacts on memory and health.
