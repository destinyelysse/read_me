              If you do something once, the long term impact may be small. The actions you do daily, however, compound their impacts over time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Winners and losers have the same goals, but different ways of achieving them. Goals represent where you
              want to go. Design a system you love and identify with that will take you to your goals. Instead of thinking "I
              want this", think "I am this". If you stick to your system, you will have reinforcing evidence that supports this statement.
            </li>
            <li>
              Habits are a logical, 4-stage problem/solution process.
              You experience a <span>cue</span> that triggers a <span>craving</span>.
              You wish to resolve it, so you <span>respond</span> and receive a
              <span>reward</span>.
            </li>
            <li>You can leverage the process to help you build strong habit systems. Modify your environment to reduce friction for habits you want to encourage, and add barriers for habits you want to reduce. Make sure you see the reward of your actions. If you stay diligent, they will compound over time.
            </li>
