        <ul class="ideas">
          <li>
            Doing something one time won't matter much inn the long term.
            However, the choices you make every day compound over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Winners and losers have the same goals. Goals represent where you
            want to go, and the system is how you get there. Design a system you
            love and identify with that will take you to your goals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <q
              >You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level
              of your systems.</q
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Your systems must align with your identity. Instead of thinking "I
            want this", think "I am this". Continuing your habit provides
            evidence for your statement. While there is nothign wrong with
            indulgence every now and then, you won't see yourself as a healthy
            person if you eat cake every day.
          </li>
          <li>
            Habits are a logical problem/solution situaiton with four stages.
            First, you experience a <span>cue</span> and a <span>craving</span>.
            You wish to resolve them, so you <span>respond</span> and receive a
            <span>reward</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can use habits to your advantage by:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Modifying your environment ton make desired cues obvious and
                undesired cues invisible
              </li>
              <li>Make the habit something you want to do</li>
              <li>
                Make your habit the easiest option if you want to encourage it,
                or add barriers to reduce the habit
              </li>
              <li>Make sure you see the reward of your actions</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Remember, your actions will compound over time if you stay diligent.
          </li>
        </ul>
