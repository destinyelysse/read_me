        <p class="author-text">
          Paul Kalanithi was a neurosurgeon-neuroscientist at Stanford who also
          had a lifelong passion for literature. Shortly before completing his
          training as a neurosurgeon, Paul was diagnosed with stage IV lung
          cancer. In his book, Paul recalls how his search for life's meaning
          led him to explore a career as a neurosurgeon, helping his patients
          make difficult decisions in the face of death - and how his own
          diagnosis changed the course of his quest.

            As a child, Paul's family moved from suburban New York to rural
            Arizona. The change in scenery presented new challenges for Paul to
            overcome. He recalls being influenced by his father's service to his
            community as a doctor

            Sleep consists of 90 minute cycles of NREM and REM sleep. During
            NREM sleep, brain waves move in unison from the front of the brain
            to the back, moving memories from short term to long term storage.
            During REM sleep, the brain paralyzes the body and begins dreaming.
            Dreams heal emotional difficulties and help unconsciously solve
            problems. While we dream, our visual, motor, emotional, and
            autobiographical portions of our brains become active, while the
            prefrontal cortex becomes inactive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whether you are a morning lark or a night owl, you have a natural
            circadian rhythm that governs the timing of your sleep cycle. Humans
            need about 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Melatonin can help you
            re-adjust your body clock after jet lag, but will not improve sleep
            quality. Contrary to popular belief, alcohol significantly impairs
            sleep, hindering our memory integration process. Science suggests
            that sleeping pills do not produce a natural sleep and have negative
            impacts on memory and health.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some animals dream, and some sleep with only half their brain at a
            time. There is no known factor determining how much sleep a
            particular species needs. Humans are the only species that use
            alarms to wake up at specific times. Since we discovered
            electricity, we adopted artificial indoor light, negatively
            impacting our sleep cycles. Modern smart technologies like bulbs and
            thermostats are reversing the trend, promoting sleep by dimming
            lights and cooling the room before bed.
          </li>

            Reduced sleep weakens the immune system and causes faster aging.
            Sleep deficiency increases your chances of heart attack by 200%. It
            is a leading cause of type 2 diabetes. Rats die after approximately
            20 days with no sleep. Not getting enough sleep can cause
            psychological diseases in teens and young adults, as well as
            Alzheimers and dementia in the elderly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sleep deprived people are not aware of their impaired performance,
            which declines to that of a drunk driver after 19 hours awake. Every
            hour, someone dies in a car accident caused by inadequate sleep.
            Sleep deprivation erodes productivity in office workers and produces
            the 3rd leading cause of death - medical errors.

            Babies are asleep nearly the entire time they are in the womb. REM
            sleep is critical for development in the third trimester and for a
            while after birth. Sleeping in a hospital is difficult yet critical
            for patients, especially premature babies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Children and elderly people have early circadian rhythms, while
            teenagers have theirs shifted forward a couple of hours later.
            Schools often have start times too early in the morning for the
            natural teenage circadian rhythm. Students perform on average 200
            SAT points better when high school start times are pushed forward 1
            hour. Adequate sleep provides proper management of short and long
            term memory, and improves learning outcomes.

          <li>
            Perhaps the best thing we can do for our physical health, emotional
            health, and intellectual pursuits, is get adequate sleep each night.
