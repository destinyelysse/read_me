          The daily choices we make every day add up over time. James Clear

        <h3>About the Author</h3>
        <p>
          Clear discovered the power of habits after being hit in the face by a
          baseball bat in high school. Despite the arduous recovery from severe
          injuries and challenges getting back into the “swing” of things on the
          baseball field (sorry), he knew he would need to take control of his
          life if he wanted to achieve his dreams. Through small daily decisions
          that compounded into long term success, Clear finished his college
          career earning accolades and honors for his academic and athletic
          performance. Clear is a bestselling author and keynote speaker.

        <h3>Favorite Ideas</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Doing something one time won't matter much inn the long term.
            However, the choices you make every day compound over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Winners and losers have the same goals. Goals represent where you
            want to go, and the system is how you get there. Design a system you
            love and identify with that will take you to your goals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <q
              >You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level
              of your systems.</q
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Your systems must align with your identity. Instead of thinking "I
            want this", think "I am this". Continuing your habit provides
            evidence for your statement. While there is nothign wrong with
            indulgence every now and then, you won't see yourself as a healthy
            person if you eat cake every day.
          </li>
          <li>
            Habits are a logical problem/solution situaiton with four stages.
            First, you experience a <span>cue</span> and a <span>craving</span>.
            You wish to resolve them, so you <span>respond</span> and receive a
            <span>reward</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can use habits to your advantage by:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Modifying your environment ton make desired cues obvious and
                undesired cues invisible
              </li>
              <li>Make the habit something you want to do</li>
              <li>
                Make your habit the easiest option if you want to encourage it,
                or add barriers to reduce the habit
              </li>
              <li>Make sure you see the reward of your actions</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Remember, your actions will compound over time if you stay diligent.
          </li>
        </ul>
