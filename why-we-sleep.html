            <li>Sleep is likely an evolutionary trait that supports our brains in creativity, intelligence, and emotional regulation.</li>

            <li>Sleep consists of 90 minute cycles of NREM and REM sleep.</li>
            <li>During NREM sleep, brain waves move in unison from the front of the brain to the back, moving memories from short term to long term storage.</li>
            <li>During REM sleep, the brain paralyzes the body and dreams occur</li>
            <li>There is not a clear detemining factor for the amount of sleep a specific species needs.</li>
            <li>Some animals dream, and some sleep with half their brain.</li>
            <li>REM sleep is considered an evolutionary benefit that made humans the dominant species.</li>
            <li>Babies are sleep nearly the entire time they are in the womb.</li>
            <li>REM sleep is critical for development in the third trimester and for a while after birth.</li>
            <li>Children and elderly people have early circadian rhythms, while teenagers have theirs shifted forward much later.</li>
            <li>A lack of sleep may cause psychological disorders in teenagers and young adults, and dementia, alzheimers, among other illnesses in elders.</li>
            <li>Adequate sleep provides proper management of short and long term memory, and improves learning outcomes.</li>
            <li>Every hour, someone dies in a car accident resulting from lack of sleep.</li>
            <li>Sleep deprived people are not aware of their impaired performance, which declines to that of a drunk driver after 19 hours awake.</li>
            <li>Sleep deficiency increases your chances of heart attack by 200%. It is a leading cause of type 2 diabetes.</li>
            <li>Reduced sleep weakens the immune system and causes faster aging.</li>
            <li>During dreaming, the visual, motor, emotional, and autobiographical portions of the brain become active. The prefrontal cortex becomes inactive and the brain paralyzes the body.</li>
            <li>Dreams heal emotional difficulties and solve problems.</li>
            <li>Lucid dreamers can control their dreams.</li>
            <li>Sleepwalking is a rare and usually harmless condition.</li>
            <li>Emotional worry or stress can cause insomnia.</li>
            <li>Rats die after approximately 20 days with no sleep.</li>
            <li>Humans need about 7-9 hours of sleep each night.</li>
            <li>While advancements in electricity and technology are beneficial for many reasons, innovations have negatively impacted sleep.</li>
            <li>A bedside lamp is powerful enough to alter your brain's sleep signals.</li>
            <li>Alcohol significantly impairs your sleep and dramatically decreases your memory abilities.</li>
            <li>We are he only species that wakes up artificially.</li>
            <li>Sleeping pills do not produce a natural sleep and have negative impacts on memory and health.</li>
            <li>Sleep deprivation erodes productivity in office workers and produces the 3rd leading cause of death - medical errors.</li>
            <li>Students perform on average 200 SAT pints better when high school start times are pushed forward 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Advancements in smart technology, like AI powered thermostats and lights, can be used to promote sleep.</li>
            <li>Schools are not teaching the benefits of getting enough sleep, and corporations often discourage sleep.</li>
            <li>Sleeping in a hospital is difficult yet critical for patients, especially premature babies.</li>
